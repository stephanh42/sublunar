The game is not yet winnable (or loose-able, for that matter;-)).
It currently has "tech demo" status.

You can try it [here](https://stephanh42.github.io/sublunar/).

## Key bindings

You can either use the traditional VI/Roguelike keys or the numpad keys.

```
       y k u             1 2 3
       h   l             4   6
       b j n             7 8 9

     traditional         numpad
    VI/Roguelike
```

The arrow keys also work but those don't allow you to move diagonally.
You can also click with the mouse on a tile adjacent to your submarine.

* Use + and - to zoom in/zoom out.
* Press T to fire a torpedo.
